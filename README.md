# Pygame-Platformer-Prototype

## Overview
This is a simple project which is a 2D Platformer, which is a prototype built with the Pygame Community Edition library for python.

The goal of this project is not to make an entire game, but to make something which I can use to learn the proper ways to work on these types of projects.

The project focuses on:
* Seperating functionality across multiple files
* Using classes effectively
* Building a scalable foundation for a project
